# bacterial_growth_model
Each of the csv files contain data for population averaged cell growth in normalized time (except for the filamentous cells, which are left in abolute time).
Datasets are stored as arrays for easy importing into software, e.g. Mathematica. 
The original, unprocessed data can be found with the following publications:

E. coli: Taheri-Araghi, S. et al. Curr. Biol. (2014)

B. subtilis: Sauls, J. et al. mBio (2019)

C. crecentus: Banerjee, S. et al. Nat. Microbiol. (2017)

Filamentous E. coli: Tanouchi, Y. et al. Sci. Data (2017)

 The included python script reproduces a minimal stochastic simulation as discussed in the paper. See comments in the code for more information.
